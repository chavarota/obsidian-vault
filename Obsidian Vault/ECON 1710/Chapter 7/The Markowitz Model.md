We can generalize portfolio construction to the case of many risky securities and a risk-free asset. As in the [[Portfolios of Two Risky Assets|two risky asset example]], the problem has 3 parts

### 1. Identify the risk-return combinations available from the set of risky assets
These are summarized by the **minimum-variance frontier** of risky assets. This is a graph of the lowest possible variance that can be attained for a given portfolio expected return (this will look like a scatter plot, with each possible portfolio being a dot. The frontier will be the line that joins the left-most points).

All the individual assets lie to the right inside the frontier.

The portion of the frontier that lies above the global minimum-variance portfolio is called the **efficient frontier of risky assets**

### 2. Identify the optimal portfolio of risky assets by finding the portfolio rates that result in the steepest CAL
The CAL generated by the optimal portfolio is the one tangent to the efficient frontier.

### 4. Choose an appropriate complete portfolio by mixing the risk-free asset to the optimal risky portfolio
