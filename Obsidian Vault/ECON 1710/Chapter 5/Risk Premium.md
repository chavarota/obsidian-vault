The [[Annual Percentage Rate|rate of return]] of a security might not be exactly known. In this case, we can perform a [[Scenario Analysis|scenario analysis]]. This is called the probability distribution of the return. This distribution is described by its [[Expected Value|expected value]] $E(r)$ and its [[Variance|standard deviation]] $\sigma$.

The risk premium is helpful in deciding how much of an expected reward is offered for the risk that an investment would entail. We define the reward as the **risk premium:** the difference between the expected holding period rate of return and the **risk-free rate**:
$$\text{Risk Premium} = E(r)-r_f$$
In order to think about the risk-return tradeoff, we use the [[Sharpe Ratio]].

N.B. The distribution of returns typically follows the [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]].
