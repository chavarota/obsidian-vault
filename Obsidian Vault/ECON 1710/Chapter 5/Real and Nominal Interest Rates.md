A nominal interest rate is the rate at which the dollar value of your account grows. The real interest rate is the rate at which the goods you can buy with your funds grows. Given the inflation rate, $i$, we can define:
$$1 + r_{real} = \frac{1+r_{nom}}{1+i}$$
A common approximation to this relation is $r_{real} \approx r_{nom} - i$. This overstates the actual real rate.
