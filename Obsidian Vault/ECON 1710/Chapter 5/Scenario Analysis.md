Scenario Analysis of a security involves creating a list of possible rates of [[Annual Percentage Rate|return]] along with their associated probabilities. To find the [[Expected Value|expected]] rate of return, we weight each outcome by its probability:
$$E(r)=\sum_{s=1}^n p(s)r(s)$$
To find the [[Variance|variance]], we must also weigh each row by its probability:
$$\sigma^2=\sum_{s=1}^n p(s)[r(s)-E(r)]^2$$
In the case of looking at historical rates of return, we can treat it as a specific type of scenario analysis in which each outcome is equally as likely. Thus the formulas become:
$$E(r)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{s=1}^n r(s)$$
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{s=1}^n[r(s)-E(r)]^2$$
