There are two types of managed investment companies: closed-end and open-end funds.

**Open end funds** (also called [[Mutual Funds]])stand ready to redeem or issue shares at their [[Net Asset Value|net asset value]]. when investors in open-end funds wish to "cash out" their shares, they sell them back to the fund at NAV.

**Closed-end funds** do not redeem or issue shares. Investors who wish to cash out must sell their shares to other investors. Think of closed-end funds as trading just like stocks.
