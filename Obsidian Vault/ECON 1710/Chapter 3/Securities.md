Firms can raise money by issuing new securities on the **primary market**. Once these securities have been issued, investors can trade them among themselves on the secondary market.

## Types of Securities

- [[Treasury Bills]]
- [[Equity Securities]]
## Types of markets
- Direct search markets
- Brokered markets (i.e. real estate)
- Dealer markets (most bonds and forex)
	- Dealers purchase assets and hope to sell them on at a higher price
- Auction markets (stock exchanges)

## Types of stock orders
- Market orders
	- Market buy: buy at ask
	- Market sell: sell at bid
- Limit buy: buy at or below a given price
- Limit sell: sell at or above a given price

## Trading costs
Full-service brokers charge a commission for stock trades, discount brokers do not.

## Buying on margin
Purchasing stocks on margin means the investor borrows part of the purchase price. The margin is the portion of the purchase price contributed by the investor:
$$\text{Margin} = \frac{\text{Equity in account}}{\text{Value of stock}}=\frac{\text{Assets - Liabilities}}{\text{Value of Stock}}$$
There is an initial margin requirement, and then a maintenance margin requirement, as margin can fluctuate depending on the price of the asset bought.

During a margin buy trade, your asset is the shares you bought, the liabilities is a dollar amount owed to the broker.

## Short sales
A short sale allows investors to profit from the decrease in price of a security. An investor borrows a share, sells it immediately, waits a while, and hopefully buys it back later at a lower price to give back to the lender.

In order to short a stock, you need to borrow the stock. This means you are on margin. Just like buying on margin, there are initial and maintenance requirements for the trade. The calculation to find margin remains the same, however in this scenario the assets and liabilities are flipped. During a short sell, your asset is the money you got for selling the stock you borrowed, and the liability is the market price of the stock multiplied by number of shares.
