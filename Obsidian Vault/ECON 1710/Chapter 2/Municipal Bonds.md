Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments. They are similar to [[Treasury Notes and Bonds|treasury]] and corporate bonds except that their interest income is exempt from federal income taxation. The interest income is also usually exempt from state and local taxation in the issuing state.

An investor choosing between taxable and tax-exempt bonds must compare after-tax returns on each bond ([[Equivalent Taxable Yield]]).
