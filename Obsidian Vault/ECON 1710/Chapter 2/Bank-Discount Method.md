A [[Treasury Bills|t-bill]]'s discount from its [[Par Value|par value]] is "annualized" based on a 360 day year and then reported as a percentage of par value. A formula to relate the asked price as a % of par to the dealer-quoted 'ASKED': 
$$a = 1 - ASKED \times\frac{d}{360}$$
Where:
- $a$ = % of par value that you have to pay
- $d$ = number of days to maturity
## Flaws
The bank-discount method is flawed for two main reasons:
1. It assumes that the year has only 360 days
2. It computes the yield as a fraction of par value, not the price the investor actually paid for the bill (the [[Bond-Equivalent Yield|bond-equivalent yield]] calculates the actual annualized yield an investor will get by holding a bill.
