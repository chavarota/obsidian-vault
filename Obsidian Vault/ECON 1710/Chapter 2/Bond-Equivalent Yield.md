The bond equivalent yield is an annualized percentage rate that an investor in a t-bill will receive by holding a given bond. The formula is:
$$r_a = \frac{P_{par}}{P_{price}} \times \frac{365}{d}$$
Where:
- $P_{par}$ = the [[Par Value|par value]] of the bill
- $P_{price}$ = the current trading price of the bill
- $r_a$ = annualized holding return
- $d$ = days until maturity
