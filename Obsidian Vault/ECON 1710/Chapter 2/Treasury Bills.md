The US government borrows money by selling bills to the public. **Investors buy the bills at a discount from the stated [[Par Value|maturity (face) value]]**. The difference between the purchase price and ultimate maturity value constitutes the interest paid on the bills.

Earnings on T-bills are exempt from local and state taxes.
## Financial Reporting
Rather than providing prices for each bill, the financial press reports bid and asked yields based on the [[Bank-Discount Method|bank-discount method]]. The "ASKED YIELD" column is the bill's [[Bond-Equivalent Yield| bond-equivalent yield]].
