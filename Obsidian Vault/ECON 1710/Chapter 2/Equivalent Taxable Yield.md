Consider an investor's choice between bond with taxed income and a bond with non-taxed income.

Define the following variables
- $t$ = the individual's combined federal plus local marginal tax bracket.
- $r_{taxable}$ = the total before-tax rate of return available on the [[Treasury Notes and Bonds|taxable bond]].
- $r_{muni}$ = the rate of return available on a tax-free [[Municipal Bonds|muni bond]].

We can say that the after tax rate available on the bond is $r_{taxable}(1-t)$

Therefore, the rate of return on taxable bonds that would be required to provide an equal after-tax return to the tax-free bond is: $r_{taxable}(1-t)=r_{muni}$.
