Mutual funds are the common name for open-end [[Investment Companies|investment companies]]. They can only be bought and sold only at the end of the day when [[Net Asset Value|NAV]] is calculated.

## Fee structure
There are 4 general classes of fees:
#### 1. Operating Expenses
These expenses are defined as a percentage of total assets under management. Whatever the fund's return is (in %), subtract the operating expense.
#### 2. Front-End Load
This is a commission paid when you initially buy into the fund. Whatever the amount of money you invest into a mutual fund, reduce that by the percentage defined by the front-end load.
#### 3. Back-End Load
Similar to the front-end load but is charged upon redemption. Whatever the amount of money you have when you sell your shares in the fund, reduce that by the percentage defined by the back-end load.
#### 4. 12b-1 Charges
These charges are like operating expenses but for marketing and distribution costs. They are also expressed as a percentage and reduce the return by that percentage every year. (i.e. a 5% gross return with a 1% 12b-1 charge leaves a 4% net return).

## Returns
The rate of return on a mutual fund is the increase in NAV plus income distributions as a fraction of previous period NAV:
$$\text{Rate of return} = \frac{NAV_1-NAV_0+ \text{Income and capital gains distributions}}{NAV_0}$$
## Taxation of income
It is the end-investor that pays capital gains and income tax on any pro-rated gains incurred in the fund. This means that a mutual fund can make trades that are "tax inefficient" for you.

A portfolio with a high portfolio turnover rate is considered "tax inefficient":
$$\text{Portfolio turnover rate} = \frac{\min(\text{Value of stocks sold}, \text{Value of stocks bought})}{\text{Average AUM}}$$

## Exchange traded funds
ETFs are mutual funds that are designed to track an index

Advantages over mutual funds:
- Trade continuously
- Can be shorted or bought on margin
- **Lower ongoing cost but ETF has trading commission**.
- Tax-efficient (choose when you sell)
