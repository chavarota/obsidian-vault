Intuitively, a portfolio is more attractive when its expected return is higher and its risk is lower. But when risk increases along with return, the most attractive portfolio is not obvious. How can we quantify this? We can construct the following utility function for the average investor:
$$U=E(r)-\frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2$$
Where $A$ is an investor's **coefficient of risk aversion**. We say that an investor is:
- **Risk-averse** if A > 0
- **Risk-neutral** if A = 0
- **Risk-loving** if A < 0
 
We can interpret the utility score of risky portfolios as a **certainty equivalent rate of return**. This is the rate that a risk-free investment would need to offer to provide the same utility as the risky portfolio.

Moving forward, we will assume that investors are risk-averse. Their utility function looks like:
