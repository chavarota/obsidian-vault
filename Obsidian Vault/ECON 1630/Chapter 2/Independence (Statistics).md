Independence says that knowing the value of X tells us nothing about the value of Y. Formally, $X$ and $Y$ are independent ($X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y$) if the conditional PDF/PMF of $Y|X=x$ is the same as the unconditional one ($p(y|x) = p(y), \forall(y,x))$.

Conditional independence is defined similarly. $Y \perp\!\!\!\perp X | W$ if $p(y | x, w) = p(y,w), \forall(y,x,w)$.
