Covariance measures the linear association between two variables:
$$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$
Notice how the [[Variance|variance]] is just a special case of covariance (the covariance of a [[Random Variables|random variable]] with itself):
$$Cov(X,X)=E[(X-E[X]^2)]$$
The *correlation* between $X$ and $Y$ is $Corr(X,Y)=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Std(X)Std(Y)}$

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[Independence (Statistics)|independent]], then $Cov(X,Y)=Corr(X,Y)=0$
